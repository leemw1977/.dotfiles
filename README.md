# .dotfiles
Lee Williams' dot files 25

I had a period away from Mac and Linux, but now I nee dotfiles again, that said, I can't believe stow passed me by last time.

## Requirements
You'll need to install [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/ "see GNU project page") using your favourite pacakge manager - I'm reliably informed homebrew has it so for macs:

`brew install stow`

Once that is done.

Clone the repo, then whichever of the dot files you wish to use you can run the relevant commands

```
stow zsh
stow ohmyzsh
stow emacs
.
.
.
```

I'll probably look to add a shell file to stow all the dot files for myself - so that should eventually be another option for anyone who stumbles onto this repo.
